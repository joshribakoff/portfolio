    As a high school senior in 2005, when drones nor Google Maps existed, I
    took on a freelance project to create{" "}
    <em>"The premier website for marine information"</em>. The client was a
    cartography partner with Garmin coordinating aerial photo shoots of
    coastal locations in a dozen countries.

    In response a plethora of DVDs showing up on my door step, I developed a
    "human in the loop" tool used by the photographers & pilots to upload
    photos from in the field. The tool made use of artificial intelligence
    algorithms to extract GPS coordinates from metadata. Recommendations were
    made along with a confidence percentage regarding how to cluster,
    classify, and catalog data by coalescing numerous data sources. Workers
    reviewed & made adjustments as needed. The system had built in
    book-keeping for compensating the workers.
  </p>
  <p>
    With our newly structured data, I mentored a team of designers in best
    practices such as HTML & CSS. We created a highly visual engaging
    directory where businesses can sign up to maintain their listing, pay more
    to show up more prominently on a map (essentially the yelp of marinas)
  </p>
  <p>
    It was also very important to the project stakeholders to show off the
    high resolution images at every opportunity, which was at a direct
    conflict with the state of internet speeds & and screen resolution
    sizes in 2006.

    A bit into the project, Google Maps had just launched, and MapQuest had
    quoted the owners $70,000/yr and they had some concerns with Google's
    terms & conditions which reserved the right to run ads on the maps (their
    business model was going to be using their maps for marketing, after all).
  </p>
  <p>
    Contrary to my recommendation to use Google Maps, I was tasked with
    building them their own maps platform. We purchased ESRI dataset called
    "Street Pro". Employing trigonometry & geometric algorithms such as
    curve orientation, I created a map rendering system using PHP & the GD
    library. The system rendered out "tiles" and took advantage of
    optimizations such as deduplicating solid land mass or ocean. Using custom
    servers with large RAID arrays that I had built to spec, I oversaw 1,000s
    of CPU hours worth of rendering for my algorithm on the cluster. A custom
    map client was built in Adobe Flash using Action Script, as HTML5 was not
    yet prevalent at the time & this was before jQuery even hit the scene. I
    essentially built a Google Maps clone in 12 weeks, during the same year
    Google Maps launched.

    When the client later re-evaluated the software offerings for maps, they
    decided Google Maps was just too compelling compared to re-inventing that
    wheel. In the longer run I helped switch the maps back to Google Maps
    because it offered more detailed maps, a richer ecosystem of integrations,
    and it became obvious Google was going to be very reasonable of a partner.
    Steve Jobs also eventually killed Flash so we would have had to re-do the
    UI client anyways.
