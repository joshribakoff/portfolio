# Copywriting Skill

When writing or editing content for this portfolio, follow these guidelines.

## Voice

- **ELI5**: Simple, clear language. No jargon without explanation.
- **Short and direct**: No fluff. Say it once, say it well.
- **Concrete over abstract**: Show what happened, not vague claims.

## Succinctness

- Cut filler words: "basically", "essentially", "in order to", "actually", "really"
- Prefer short sentences
- One idea per paragraph in body text
- One idea per bullet point in lists
- If you can say it in fewer words, do

## Examples

Bad:
> I essentially worked on building out the frontend infrastructure, which basically involved creating reusable components that the team could actually use across different parts of the application.

Good:
> I built the frontend component library. The team uses it across the app.

Bad:
> This project was really exciting because it gave me the opportunity to actually learn a lot about how AI systems work in practice.

Good:
> This project taught me how AI systems fail in production.

## Portfolio-Specific Guidelines

- **Lead with outcomes**, not process
- **Quantify when possible**: "reduced load time by 40%" beats "improved performance"
- **Show judgment**: What tradeoffs did you make? What would you do differently?
- **Avoid buzzword stacking**: "Leveraged cutting-edge AI to synergize..." — no.
